## Object-Oriented Snake Game

This Python project is an object-oriented implementation of the classic Snake game built using the Turtle graphics library. In this game, you control a snake on the screen, guiding it to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own tail.

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the script.

2. After starting the game, use the arrow keys to move the snake around the board.

3. As the snake finds and eats food, it will grow longer.

4. The game continues until one of the following conditions is met:
   - The snake moves off the screen (collides with the walls).
   - The snake moves into itself (collides with its own tail).

5. The goal of the game is to make the snake as large as possible before it encounters one of these conditions.

6. The game keeps track of your score, which increases each time the snake eats food.

7. You can click anywhere on the screen to exit the game when you're done playing.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented:** This Snake game is developed using object-oriented programming principles for code structure and organization.

- **Snake Movement:** Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake.

- **Food:** The snake grows when it eats food items.

- **Scoring:** The game keeps track of your score.

- **Collision Detection:** The game detects collisions with the walls and the snake's tail.

- **User-Friendly:** The game provides a user prompt to initiate play.

## Customize

You can customize various aspects of the game by modifying the code, such as changing the game's appearance, the initial speed, or the game-over conditions.

## Dependencies

This game uses the Turtle graphics library, which is included with Python, so there's no need to install additional packages.

## Acknowledgments

- This project uses Python and the Turtle graphics library for game development.


Enjoy playing your object-oriented Snake game!
